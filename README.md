In this application, the objective was to analyze a file with the acceptance of coupons by drivers and distinguish those who accept from those who do not.

Two types of coupons were evaluated: bar coupons and coffee house coupons.

According to the analysis that considers only dataframe entries referring to bar coupons, the probability of a driver accepting the coupon is directly related to the number of times the driver frequents bars. 
The acceptance rate in the group of drivers who go to bar more than 3 times is 0.761658. This is the most important variable for this kind of coupon.

For coupons referring to 'Coffee House':

    - The acceptance rate of coffee house coupons is 0.496331.
    
    - The acceptance rate of coffee house coupons is higher at 10AM and 2PM.
    
    - Drivers under 21 are more likely to accept the coupon.
    
    - The occupation that har the higher acceptance rate is Healthcare Practitioners & Technical (around 0.76).
    
    - People who are with partners or friends are more likely to accept the coupon.
    
    - Drivers that usually go to Coffee Houses more than once a month are more likely to accept the coupon.
